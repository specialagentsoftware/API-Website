## Blog Intro 9/25/2020

Ok. I always do this. I have had this server for a long time. I from time to time will want to learn another framweork or some other technology so I will re-roll the whole thing and I almost always make a small blog. I decided to go bare bones this time. I have several different endpoints running on this server ranging from rest api's to games, a resume page, and other stuff all behind nginx. Its all written in python using flask. This blog is just a markfown file, because I do not really care. I dont want comments, I dont want likes. I did not want to hook this up to the sessions or the user management system I have. This is just a place for me to dump my complaints and thoughts. I just basically mess around with this. I am a software engineer. So if I were a career mechanic. This server is my home garage.  

## Senior photos 9/25/2020

We just bought 3 senior portraits of my daughter. It cost **$400** dollars. 

Read that again, I will wait.

I could have bought the gown, and paid a professional photographer not affiliated with the who the school selected and came out cheaper with more poses, backgrounds and would have recieved probably 15 or 20 different photos. How did this photpgraphy company get affiliated with the school? I would wager there was some soul selling involved. Because this is a freaking amazing deal for them. You are the only people who can take these pictures and you can charge any damn amount that these freaking idiots will pay... oh and we will pay. :-(

## Religous ferver 9/25/2020

I am not sure why in the world we allow peoples individual beliefs to make decisions for other people who do not necessarily have those beliefs. For example, If I as a legal adult wish to purchase beer on a Sunday. I am not allowed to do so until after 12pm. Do I have anything to do with a church or religion? Nope. I am impeded of course because others feel like their own religion would be destroyed if I buy a beer on Sunday morning.

If your religious beliefs are so week that I can destroy them by doing something I am legally entitled to do as an adult. Then you my friend are a weak ass (insert whatever denomination/religion you want here)

I used alchohol but anything can be substituted. (sexuality, marital status, stance on pork, etc)

I think the real problem is people being interested in controlling everyone else. I happen to think its bullshit. We just need to take care of our own shit and butt out of other people business. 

The only exception for this but the hell out policy is when other people are endangered by your actions. That is the only reason for society to step in with regard to an individuals action. I am a firm believer in isolationism. I just feel that instead of America needing to stay out of world politics (that ship sailed long ago), I feel that a society of people should be isolated from an individuals rights to be able to reasonably do what ever in the hell they want.

## Property taxes 9/25/2020

I understand the need for taxes. We have infrastructure that needs to be paid for, we need to be able to offer services to people who need them. I am perfectly fine with that. I happily give all of my income to be taxed when I make it, I submit to taxes when I purchase things, I submit to taxes when I get a loan, I submit to taxes when I pull money out of certain types of accounts. What makes me more angry than any of these taxes is property taxes. We have always said that home ownership is something to long for. The awful secret is though that we will never fully own anything. I can buy a house and pay for 30 years to my mortgage lender and finally "own" the home. However, that is folly. Neither the bank nor the "owner" actually owns the home. The county owns the home and the land, because you pay them a portion of the value to be able to continue to live there. The deed you were given when you "paid off" your home is useless. If you do not believe me, just fail to pay your taxes. One day the county will auction it off for a fraction of what it is worth and you will be out. If you do not leave, the police (that you paid with your other taxes) will escort you off the county's land.
