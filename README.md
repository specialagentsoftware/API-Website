# API-Website

This is the api I have hosted that provides several things.. the endpoint for a trivia game I wrote, the end point for several api.com api's that I have hosted there.. and the endpoint for my personal resume website. There are probably a few other things too I am forgetting. 

There are several places that need to be refactored. For example, a config file needs to be added to keep credentials out of the main app code and header checks should all be rolled up into one function that can just be callsed during each response. There are several other places. I will do this one day. As this is just an app that I add stuff to as I think of things to do.. its not really meant for anyone to use it other than myself.
